            <p>Hi! I am Denise, you can call me Den!</p>
            <p>I had a few experience with HTML and JavaScript back in high school</p>
            <p>since the curriculum of my school had an IT as a subject and learning</p>
            <p>basic programming was one of our lessons, like HTML and JavaScript</p>
            <p>I specifically had a liking in web programming as well as designing</p>
            <p>GUIs were basically my favorite thing to do in a project.</p>
            <p>My HTML program back in Grade 9 was a 1st placer and I can't seem to</p>
            <p>find the souce code, but I just think it is worth mentioning because</p>
            <p>that achievement got me to where I am today!</p>
