            <h2>Web Application Idea</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Duh Trends Web-Based Sales and Inventory Management System is designed to 
                streamline the operations of Duh Trends by automating the sales recording and 
                inventory tracking process for vendors. Currently, vendors rely on manual methods to 
                track their stocks, while store staff are responsible for recording sales based on item 
                codes. This traditional approach can lead to errors, inefficiencies, and difficulties in 
                managing inventory effectively.
                </p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this project is to provide a centralized, web-based platform where 
                vendors can monitor their sales and manage their inventory more efficiently. Instead of 
                relying on separate spreadsheets or manual stock counting, vendors will be able to 
                access real-time sales reports and adjust their supply accordingly.</p>
